I'm here to provide insights into the development process of our BMI Calculator app in Java. Here's a breakdown of how I structured the project and achieved key objectives:

<b>User Interaction:</b> Prioritizing a seamless user experience, I implemented prompts for users to input their weight and height.

<b>BMI Calculation:</b> Precision was paramount. I utilised float data types and the math.pow function to ensure accurate BMI computations.

<b>Weight Categorization:</b> To provide meaningful feedback, I categorized users based on their BMI, employing conditional statements to determine weight status.

<b>In terms of project structure:</b>
<ul>
  <li>I organized the project within a package and imported necessary dependencies.</li>
  <li>With the main method established, I instantiated a Scanner object for user input.</li>
  <li>Utilizing println prompts, I guided users through the input process.</li>
  <li>Maintaining clarity and efficiency, I used float data types for variables.</li>
  <li>Lastly, I employed conditional statements to categorize BMI results.</li>
</ul>
