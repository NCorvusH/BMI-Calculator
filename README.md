I'm here to provide insights into the development process of our BMI Calculator app in Java. Here's a breakdown of how I structured the project and achieved key objectives:

User Interaction: Prioritizing a seamless user experience, I implemented prompts for users to input their weight and height.

BMI Calculation: Precision was paramount. I utilised float data types and the math.pow function to ensure accurate BMI computations.

Weight Categorization: To provide meaningful feedback, I categorized users based on their BMI, employing conditional statements to determine weight status.

In terms of project structure:

I organized the project within a package and imported necessary dependencies.
With the main method established, I instantiated a Scanner object for user input.
Utilizing println prompts, I guided users through the input process.
Maintaining clarity and efficiency, I used float data types for variables.
Lastly, I employed conditional statements to categorize BMI results.
